# Orthogonal Classes
Proposed EcmaScript Class Syntax clarifying orthogonal concerns

## Non-Orthogonal Goals
  1. Compatible with existing EcmaScript classes
  1. Express private fields and public properties
  1. Easy to understand
  1. Hard to misunderstand
  1. Initialization syntax that does not invite confusion with assignment
  1. Enable an annotation to annotate many fields and/or properties together
  1. Express private methods and private static methods
  1. Be understandable in a "shallow wide" sense
  1. Invite understanding to become "deeper and narrower"
  1. Don't cut off sensible choices without good reason
  1. Avoid combinatorial explosion of ad hoc syntaxes to express many sensible choices
